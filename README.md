# TBotCVGames
The idea of the project is to create a telegram bot that hosts games which can be played using photos or videos processed by computer vision methods. 
At the moment, the main planned game is rock-paper-scissors, where two people will be able to play by sending the bot a photo of their hand in the form of a figure, and the bot will determine the winner.
